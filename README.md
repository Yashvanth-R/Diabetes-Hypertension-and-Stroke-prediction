# Diabetes-Hypertension-and-Stroke-prediction

Diabetes is an illness where a body cannot produce or effectively use insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. The signs include increased thirst, frequent urination, and weight loss. Complications can include heart disease, nerve damage, and vision loss. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar.
Stroke occurs when blood supply to the brain is interrupted, either by a blood clot or a burst blood artery, a stroke results.

Symptoms include sudden weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking and severe headache. Strokes can cause permanent brain damage and disability or death. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States.
In hypertension, often known as high blood pressure, the pressure of the blood in the arteries is abnormally high. This puts strain on the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. It is often symptomless but can be detected through regular blood pressure checks. 
It can be managed through lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, and stress reduction, and medication may be necessary in severe cases. These chronic diseases can lead to serious complications and disabilities, making early detection and prediction essential for effective treatment and management.

Diabetes, hypertension, and stroke are significant health concerns worldwide, contributing to a substantial burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early detection and prediction of these conditions play a crucial role in preventing complications, improving patient outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs. Computational algorithms have emerged as valuable tools in predicting and managing these chronic diseases.
